NAME
       kill - send a signal to a process

SYNOPSIS
       kill [options] <pid> [...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  default  signal for kill is TERM.  Use -l or -L to list available signals.  Particularly useful signals include HUP, INT, KILL, STOP, CONT, and 0.  Alternate signals may be
       specified in three ways: -9, -SIGKILL or -KILL.  Negative PID values may be used to choose whole process groups; see the PGID column in ps command output.  A PID of -1  is  spe‚Äê
       cial; it indicates all processes except the kill process itself and init.

OPTIONS
       <pid> [...]
              Send signal to every <pid> listed.

       -<signal>
       -s <signal>
       --signal <signal>
              Specify the signal to be sent.  The signal can be specified by using name or number.  The behavior of signals is explained in signal(7) manual page.

       -q, --queue value
              Use  sigqueue(3) rather than kill(2) and the value argument is used to specify an integer to be sent with the signal. If the receiving process has installed a handler for
              this signal using the SA_SIGINFO flag to sigaction(2) , then it can obtain this data via the si_value field of the siginfo_t structure.

       -l, --list [signal]
              List signal names.  This option has optional argument, which will convert signal number to signal name, or other way round.

       -L, --table
              List signal names in a nice table.

       NOTES  Your shell (command line interpreter) may have a built-in kill command.  You may need to run the command described here as /bin/kill to solve the conflict.

EXAMPLES
       kill -9 -1
              Kill all processes you can kill.

       kill -l 11
              Translate number 11 into a signal name.

       kill -L
              List the available signal choices in a nice table.

       kill 123 543 2341 3453
              Send the default signal, SIGTERM, to all those processes.
              
              
NAME
       pgrep, pkill, pidwait - look up, signal, or wait for processes based on name and other attributes

SYNOPSIS
       pgrep [options] pattern
       pkill [options] pattern
       pidwait [options] pattern

DESCRIPTION
       pgrep looks through the currently running processes and lists the process IDs which match the selection criteria to stdout.  All the criteria have to match.  For example,

              $ pgrep -u root sshd

       will only list the processes called sshd AND owned by root.  On the other hand,

              $ pgrep -u root,daemon

       will list the processes owned by root OR daemon.

       pkill will send the specified signal (by default SIGTERM) to each process instead of listing them on stdout.

       pidwait will wait for each process instead of listing them on stdout.

OPTIONS
       -signal
       --signal signal
              Defines the signal to send to each matched process.  Either the numeric or the symbolic signal name can be used.  (pkill only.)

       -c, --count
              Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching processes.  When count does not match anything, e.g. returns zero, the command will return non-zero value. Note that for
              pkill and pidwait, the count is the number of matching processes, not the processes that were successfully signaled or waited for.

       -d, --delimiter delimiter
              Sets the string used to delimit each process ID in the output (by default a newline).  (pgrep only.)

       -e, --echo
              Display name and PID of the process being killed.  (pkill only.)

       -f, --full
              The pattern is normally only matched against the process name.  When -f is set, the full command line is used.

       -g, --pgroup pgrp,...
              Only match processes in the process group IDs listed.  Process group 0 is translated into pgrep's, pkill's, or pidwait's own process group.

       -G, --group gid,...
              Only match processes whose real group ID is listed.  Either the numerical or symbolical value may be used.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Match processes case-insensitively.

       -l, --list-name
              List the process name as well as the process ID.  (pgrep only.)

       -a, --list-full
              List the full command line as well as the process ID.  (pgrep only.)
         
              -n, --newest
              Select only the newest (most recently started) of the matching processes.

       -o, --oldest
              Select only the oldest (least recently started) of the matching processes.

       -O, --older secs
              Select processes older than secs.

       -P, --parent ppid,...
              Only match processes whose parent process ID is listed.

       -s, --session sid,...
              Only match processes whose process session ID is listed.  Session ID 0 is translated into pgrep's, pkill's, or pidwait's own session ID.

       -t, --terminal term,...
              Only match processes whose controlling terminal is listed.  The terminal name should be specified without the "/dev/" prefix.

       -u, --euid euid,...
              Only match processes whose effective user ID is listed.  Either the numerical or symbolical value may be used.

       -U, --uid uid,...
              Only match processes whose real user ID is listed.  Either the numerical or symbolical value may be used.

       -v, --inverse
              Negates the matching.  This option is usually used in pgrep's or pidwait's context.  In pkill's context the short option is disabled to avoid accidental usage of the option.

       -w, --lightweight
              Shows all thread ids instead of pids in pgrep's or pidwait's context.  In pkill's context this option is disabled.

       -x, --exact
              Only match processes whose names (or command lines if -f is specified) exactly match the pattern.

       -F, --pidfile file
              Read PIDs from file.  This option is more useful for pkillorpidwait than pgrep.

       -L, --logpidfile
              Fail if pidfile (see -F) not locked.

       -r, --runstates D,R,S,Z,...
              Match only processes which match the process state.

       --ns pid
              Match processes that belong to the same namespaces. Required to run as root to match processes from other users. See --nslist for how to limit which namespaces to match.

       --nslist name,...
              Match only the provided namespaces. Available namespaces: ipc, mnt, net, pid, user,uts.

       -q, --queue value
              Use sigqueue(3) rather than kill(2) and the value argument is used to specify an integer to be sent with the signal. If the receiving process has installed  a  handler  for  this
              signal using the SA_SIGINFO flag to sigaction(2) , then it can obtain this data via the si_value field of the siginfo_t structure.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.
             
       -h, --help
              Display help and exit.
